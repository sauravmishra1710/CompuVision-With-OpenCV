    "# Image Blurring and Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Image blurring is achieved by convolving the image with a low-pass filter kernel. It is useful for removing noise. \n",
    "    It removes high frequency content (eg: noise, edges) from the image. So edges are blurred a little bit in this \n",
    "    operation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## What is Convolution ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mathematically, the convolution operation is the summation of the element-wise product of two matrices. Letâ€™s take two \n",
    "    matrices, X and Y. If we convolve the matrix X using the filter Y, this operation will produce the matrix Z. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For example - \n",
    "\n",
    "                                       \n",
    "                     1\t2\t3                              3\t2\t0\n",
    "           X =       2\t0\t0                     Y =      3\t0\t1\n",
    "                     7\t9\t1                              0\t5\t2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                                       \n",
    "                     1x3=3\t2x2=4\t 3x0=0                 3    4    0\n",

    " ## Convolving an Image\n",
    " \n",
    "     Convolution is an operation that is performed on an image to extract features from it by applying a filter/kernel which\n",
    "     slides over the image. A filter convolves an image and extracts features from each 'patch'.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     An image can be thought of as a bigger matrix and the kernel would be a relatively smaller matrix that sits on top of \n",
    "     the big image & slides from left to right and top to bottom until it has seen all the pixels. As the kernel slides over\n",
    "     the image it applies the convolution operation at each pixel. The convolution may be applied in either the spatial or \n",
    "     frequency domai. It is used for blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and other image processing functions.\n",
    "     \n",
    "#### Spatial Domain -\n",
    "   \n",
    "     In the spatial domain, the first part of the convolution process multiplies the elements of the kernel by the matching\n",
    "     pixel values when the kernel is centered over a pixel. The elements of the resulting array (which is the same size as \n",
    "     the kernel) are averaged, and the original pixel value is replaced with this result. \n",
    "     \n",
    "#### Frequency Domain -\n",
    "     \n",
    "     In the frequency domain, convolution is performed by multiplying the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) of the image by the \n",
    "     FFT of the kernel, and then transforming back into the spatial domain. The kernel is padded with zero values to enlarge \n",
    "     it to the same size as the image before the forward FFT is applied. \n",
    "     (NOTE: Read link 5 in the Ref section below)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     In image processing, a convolution requires 3 components:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. An input image.\n",
    "        2. A kernel matrix that we are going to apply to the input image.\n",
    "        3. An output image to store the output of the input image convolved with the kernel.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",

    "# 2D Convolution (Image Filtering)\n",
    "\n",
    "    As in one-dimensional signals, images also can be filtered with various low-pass filters (LPF), high-pass filters (HPF), \n",
    "    etc. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    LPF helps in removing noise, blurring images, etc. \n",

    "    \n",
    "#### Low Pass Filtering\n",
    "    A low pass filter is the basis for most smoothing methods. An image is smoothed by decreasing the disparity between \n",
    "    pixel values by averaging nearby pixels. Smoothing is often used to reduce noise within an image or to produce a less \n",
    "    pixelated image. Most smoothing methods are based on low pass filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Smoothing is also usually based on a single value representing the image, such as the average value of the image or the \n",
    "    median value.\n",

    "#### High Pass Filtering\n",
    "    A high pass filter is the basis for most sharpening methods. An image is sharpened when contrast is enhanced between \n",
